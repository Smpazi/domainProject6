A local clinic wants to provide a patient management system to enable doctors, nurses and receptionist to store patient information electronically rather than working a complete workflow. With this system, all users must first register and login to assess patient management system. The registration process involves the user providing ID number, address and telephone number, when they are logged, they will provide user name and password. All users have to own one account for login. This system will work well with appointment management system, since the patient have to come in to the clinic on appointment time given to them. Only nearby new patients are allowed in this clinic, because all the medication in the clinic is calculated for only a maximum number of people on that area.
Once receptionist is logged in, he/she has to add patient, search patient, check appointments and update/edit while logged in nurse add treatment for patient, issue out drugs such as tablets/medicine, search patient records, view patient status and update it and place next check-up for patients. 
Registered doctors search for patient, view patient medical records, edit/update records, add notes to patient records, write prescriptions, write referral letters, write transfer letter.
